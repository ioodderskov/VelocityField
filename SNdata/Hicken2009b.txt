              We combine the CfA3 supernovae Type Ia (SN Ia) sample with samples from the literature to calculate improved
              constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter, w. The CfA3 sample is added to the Union set of
              Kowalski et al. to form the Constitution set and, combined with a BAO prior, produces 1 + w = 0.013+0.066                                −0.068
              (0.11 syst), consistent with the cosmological constant. The CfA3 addition makes the cosmologically useful
              sample of nearby SN Ia between 2.6 and 2.9 times larger than before, reducing the statistical uncertainty to the
              point where systematics play the largest role. We use four light-curve fitters to test for systematic differences:
              SALT, SALT2, MLCS2k2 (RV = 3.1), and MLCS2k2 (RV = 1.7). SALT produces high-redshift Hubble
              residuals with systematic trends versus color and larger scatter than MLCS2k2. MLCS2k2 overestimates the
              intrinsic luminosity of SN Ia with 0.7 < Δ < 1.2. MLCS2k2 with RV = 3.1 overestimates host-galaxy
              extinction while RV ≈ 1.7 does not. Our investigation is consistent with no Hubble bubble. We also find
              that, after light-curve correction, SN Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr hosts are intrinsically fainter than those in E/S0 hosts
              by 2σ , suggesting that they may come from different populations. We also find that SN Ia in Scd/Sd/Irr
              hosts have low scatter (0.1 mag) and reddening. Current systematic errors can be reduced by improving SN Ia
              photometric accuracy, by including the CfA3 sample to retrain light-curve fitters, by combining optical SN Ia
              photometry with near-infrared photometry to understand host-galaxy extinction, and by determining if different
              environments give rise to different intrinsic SN Ia luminosity after correction for light-curve shape and color.

Figure 4. Contour plots of w vs. ΩM in a flat universe. The concordance cosmology (w = −1, ΩΛ = 0.73, ΩM = 0.27) is shown as a dot in each plot. The two plots
on the left are for SALT while the two plots on the right are for MLCS17. The top row of plots show how adding the CfA3 sample considerably narrows the contours
along the w-axis. The second row of plots show the combination of the SN contours with the BAO prior.

Figure 8. Good correlation between MLCS17 and MLCS31 host-galaxy reddening: E(B − V )host = AV /RV . Diagonal lines plotted in upper-left and lower-right
panels to aid the eye. In SALT and SALT2, c is a combination of intrinsic redness and host reddening. The red asterisks are intrinsically red objects with Δ 0.7.
The lower, diagonal boundary in the SALT/2 vs. MLCS17 comparisons is the region where the SN Ia are intrinsically blue but suffer host reddening. There is good
correlation between SALT/2 and MLCS17 for the objects that are intrinsically blue. The points above this lower edge are intrinsically redder and show that c also
measures intrinsic redness and cannot be directly compared with E(B − V ).
