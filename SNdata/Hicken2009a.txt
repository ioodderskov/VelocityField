             We present multiband photometry of 185 type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), with over 11,500 observations. These
             were acquired between 2001 and 2008 at the F. L. Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
             for Astrophysics (CfA). This sample contains the largest number of homogeneously observed and reduced
             nearby SNe Ia (z                       0.08) published to date. It more than doubles the nearby sample, bringing SN Ia
             cosmology to the point where systematic uncertainties dominate. Our natural system photometry has a precision
             of       0.02 mag in BV RI r i and                                0.04 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag. We also estimate a
             systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in our SN Ia standard system BV RI r i photometry and 0.07 mag for
             U. Comparisons of our standard system photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars,
             where available for the same SN, reveal agreement at the level of a few hundredths mag in most cases. We
             find that 1991bg-like SNe Ia are sufficiently distinct from other SNe Ia in their color and light-curve-shape/
             luminosity relation that they should be treated separately in light-curve/distance fitter training samples. The
             CfA3 sample will contribute to the development of better light-curve/distance fitters, particularly in the few
             dozen cases where near-infrared photometry has been obtained and, together, can help disentangle host-galaxy
             reddening from intrinsic supernova color, reducing the systematic uncertainty in SN Ia distances due to dust.

                    2.8. Systematic Uncertainty
   The uncertainties of our comparison star photometry take
into account both statistical uncertainty and the uncertainty
in the photometric transformation and so no systematic er-
ror needs to be added. However, in calculating the differen-
tial photometry zero point to be added to the SN and its un-
certainty (by calculating the weighted mean of the difference
of the instrumental and calibrated magnitudes of the com-
parison stars) the individual star errors are treated as if they
were purely statistical. The zero-point error is roughly equal
to the typical individual comparison star uncertainty divided
by the square root of the number of stars. This usually low-
ers the differential-photometry zero-point uncertainty below the
amount of systematic uncertainty contained in the individual
comparison star values and so our SN photometry uncertainties
can be considered accurate in the natural system. A system-         Figure 14. Hubble diagram of the CfA3 (red) and OLD (black) nearby SNe Ia.

The upper-left panel shows an upward curving distribution that can be broken
into three, somewhat arbitrary, groupings. The slow and normal decliners with
−0.4      Δ < 0.7 have a typical color of (B − V )max ≈ −0.1, although the
upward trend in color starts in the right portion of this group. The second group
has a typical color of 0.1 with −0.7 < Δ < 1.4 and includes objects similar
to both 1992A and 1986G. This second group may be a “transitional” group
(or “intersectional” if there are two underlying groups), both photometrically
and spectroscopically, to the third group, consisting of 1991bg-like SN Ia, with
(B − V )max ≈ 0.5 and Δ ≈ 1.5.

This is plotted against Δm15 (B) and Δ. A linear trend is evident in both lower
panels, except for the faintest objects which are all 1991bg-like. The relation
between MB and Δ is tighter than between MB and Δm15 (B). If objects below
zCMB = 0.01 were included then three more 1991bg-like SNe Ia would be in the
vicinity of (Δ = 1.5, MB = −17), but with higher uncertainty due to peculiar

is Δm15 (B). Part of this may be due to the larger uncertainties
in our Δm15 (B) measurements.
   Focusing on the lower right panel of Figure 22, there
appears to be a linear relation between B-band intrinsic absolute
magnitude and Δ, out to Δ ≈ 1.2. In V, the three faint and
high-Δ objects are 1991bg-like objects. We also note that
if the z = 0.01 cut were not made that there would be
several more 1991bg-like objects from our direct light-curve
measurements with Δ ≈ 1.5 and MB ≈ −17, confirming
the faint and separate nature of 1991bg-like SNe Ia. In order
to include these, MLCS2k2 uses a positive term in Δ but
this comes at the expense of underestimating the luminosity
of the SN Ia in the range 0.7 < Δ < 1.2 (see Figure 23
where the solid line shows the dependence of intrinsic absolute
magnitude versus Δ for the MLCS2k2 model light curves).
It may be better to avoid 1991bg-like objects altogether for
use in the light-curve-shape/magnitude relation, or to at least
treat them separately. Removing them can be accomplished by
spectroscopic identification of 1991bg-like features or by simply                Figure 24. SN Ia U absolute magnitude vs. Δm15 (B) and Δ. Same as in Figure 22
